# COVID19-QuarantineModel

## Introduction

This live script models people's life under dynamic zero policy in the situation of COVID-19 in China. The idea is not coming from pandemics in a strict sense, but from the self-mockery of Chinese people as illustrated below.

The code is self-explanatory and have quite a few parameters to play with. So far, it is only supported for MATLAB but can be easily implemented in other programming languages. Again, this is only a toy model that was developed for joyfulness. Feel free to make modifications or re-invent on top of this script and leave comments on mistakes or ways to improve. Thank you.

## Preliminary results

Single-runtime:

Campaign:

## Explanation

Please see the PDF in the example folder for all the details ;)

Much better, play with the tunable parameters in live script (with file format: '.mlx', and MATLAB required).
